      "You know the time of the day were you feel so tired of working and you just want to sleep or rest your head for work. When I can't sleep , I go to tiktok and get some energy back. By the way, I have two tiktok accounts. One lyrics of songsÂ because I love music and of course I want to know the lyrics to every song, and the other isÂ Â aboutÂ relatableÂ videos. Anyway, that's all for today,see you in the next post.ðŸ˜‚",

    "People ask me  when I got into tech. And I donâ€™t know the answer to this but I know I got to know about it in 2019 but I really got into tech in 2020 and took it seriously in 2021.",
    desc:"In 2019, I learned HTML and CSS in a summer coding session that my sister took me to in 2019. I learned what coding was all about from that point on, not even the tech part.   That was simple, all right. Never thought of it like that before.  After the summer course, I resumed my schoolÂ (boarding house). When I told my computer teacher what I had done over the summer, he said it was nice but advised me to learn Corel Draw since that is what we had been using in class. I didn't have time to code while I was in school, so I put it off until my next vacation. When I came home, I picked up coding again and practiced using FreeCodeCamp. I completed the course on responsive designs. At this time, I was overjoyed that 2020 was already over.",
    desc2:"I fully entered the tech world in 2021. I defined myself as a front-end developer. In comparison to when I started in 2019, I knew a lot more. Yes, I was accepted into several internship programs. I have learned with the public and continue to do so. I participated in 100 Days of Code, however I never achieved my goal for it. I joined (HNG, ZURI, KODECAMP, SIDEHUSTEL). ",
    desc3: " In 2022, my journey was already going smoothly much like a plane. My skills has now advance and I have a portfolio. In order to become more skilled, I built projects and continue to master new skills. What I am learning is getting in the way of who I want to be. I want to be a full-stack developer and a frontend developer at the same time. I'm just trying to follow my passions so that I won't look back and regret anything. I recently went to my first tech event genztechies, where I met many inspiring young people who are changing or will change the world. That day was great; I connected with several of them and learned a lot. I really want to keep coming up with incredible projects and working with people till I find a job at this point in my life. That will be the best time ever.",

      "Being consistent in your career, lifestyle, and other aspects of your life is difficult at least for some people like me. I simply want to work for 8 hours each day before going to bed. It becomes boring to do this every day, but I still try to sometimes post on social media to let people know that I'm still alive. I create content like a baddie and bless people with my pretty pictures. I'm making an effort to balance my lifestyle with my career. It works for others, therefore I can be sure that it will work for me.",

Well, today is my first day, and I designed an app called Counter using (HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT) I spent less than an hour preparing for this project by reading some articles online and watching a few YouTube videos, both of which were quite helpful.",

     "This internship took place from May to July of 2022. I was learning python while on the backend track (Django). I've always been curious about how Python functions. ",
     desc:"Python wasn't horrible; in fact, I would pick it over JavaScript any day. By giving me assignments each week with a deadline that I must meet, Zuri assisted me in learning. In all but one of my assignments, I received 100%. I had a buddy, and we constantly collaborated on things, so the experience was cool and the best for me. ",
     desc2:"After that, Zuri went on to the project phase. I registered for Zuri incorrectly, which prevented me from entering. I tried making a new email account using the one I typed incorrectly, but I still wasn't able to receive any mail from them, so I went to complain to the people in charge. They weren'tÂ  responding, so I gave up, but I will definitely be in touch with them to get my certificate.",
